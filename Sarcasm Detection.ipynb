    "Sarcasm has been part of our language for many years. It means being the opposite of what you mean, usually with a distinct tone of voice in a fun way. If you think that anyone can understand sarcasm, then you are wrong, because understanding sarcasm depends on your language skills and your knowledge of other people’s minds. But what about a computer? Is it possible to train a machine learning model that can detect whether a sentence is sarcastic or not? Yes, it is! So if you want to learn how to detect sarcasm with machine learning, this article is for you. In this article, I will walk you through the task of Sarcasm Detection with Machine Learning using Python."

    "Sarcasm means being funny by being the opposite of what you mean. It has been part of every human language for years. Today, it is also used in news headlines and various other social media platforms to gain more attention. Sarcasm detection is a natural language processing and binary classification task. We can train a machine learning model to detect whether or not a sentence is sarcastic using a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences that I found on Kaggle.\n",
