# SarcasmDetection
This repository contains a Python script for detecting sarcasm in text using machine learning. The task is to train a model that can classify whether a given sentence is sarcastic or not. This project uses natural language processing techniques and a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences to build and evaluate the model.

Features
- Data Preparation: Loads and preprocesses the dataset to prepare it for training.
- Model Training: Uses the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm to train a sarcasm detection model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance on a test set.
- Prediction: Allows users to input a text and get a prediction on whether it is sarcastic or not.
