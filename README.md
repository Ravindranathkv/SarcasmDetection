# SarcasmDetection
This repository contains a Python script for detecting sarcasm in text using machine learning. The task is to train a model that can classify whether a given sentence is sarcastic or not. This project uses natural language processing techniques and a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences to build and evaluate the model.
